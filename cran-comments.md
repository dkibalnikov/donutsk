## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Operator `<<-`  is removed. Package functions does not modify the global environment now. 
* Package doesn't have any academic publications references. Comment refers to inquiry:  

> If there are references describing the methods in your package, please
> add these in the description field of your DESCRIPTION file in the form
> authors (year) <doi:...>
> authors (year) <arXiv:...>
> authors (year, ISBN:...)
> or if those are not available: <https:...>
> with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:', 'https:' and angle brackets for
> auto-linking. (If you want to add a title as well please put it in
> quotes: "Title")

* Title is modified to title case that is: 'Construct Advanced Donut Charts'
